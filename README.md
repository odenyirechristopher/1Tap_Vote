# 1Tap_Vote

1Tap_Vote is a web application that is meant to replace the manual voting system in institutions of higher learning.It will help solve a number of problems related to the manual process.

1.Reduces paper work where the voter just need to click a button and vote candidate of their choice, compared to the manual where ballot papers are printed.

2.It will help save time spent queuing by the voters, since they can do it from their comfort of their seats using either a computer or their phone.

3.There are minimal chances to get spoilt votes since a voter can only select one candidate for a certain position.

4.Tallying of votes is automated and real-times compared to the manual process where it can be prone to errors due to fatigue.
